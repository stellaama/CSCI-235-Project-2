# CSCI-235-Project-2
This is my project 2 for my class, Software Analysis and Design 2

The following project will ask for a string of symbols which we refer as “target string”.
It then asks for the size of “elements” set. “Elements” is the set of strings that make up the "target string." After receiving the set size, the program asks for each string of the set.
Then the program outputs the sequence of “elements” that make up target string when concatenated. The sequence of elements should be outputted in the form of indexes from the elements set.

Here is an example:
Target string is “abbccca”. 
Elements set has a size of 3.
The elements are: “a”, “bb” and “ccc” (in this order). 
So the output shows 0 1 2 0 because “abbccca” is “a”+”bb”+”ccc”+”a”.
